## Carrom-Tac-Toe

This little game is the digital incarnation of a fun game that we used to play as kids.
After being fed up with carrom, we used to flip the board over and make use of that 3x3 grid
at the back to play our own little game.

### `Rules`

It's a game played between two players.
Each player has three coins which are either white or black in color.
For the first three tries, the players will place these coins on a 3x3 board.

After the players have exhausted their coins, they can move 
the coins either horizontally or vertically, one position at a time.
A coin cannot be moved into a position that is occupied by other coin. 
You cannot jump or skip over another coin.

The objective of the game is similar to one we have in Tic-Tac-Toe.
Any player who is able to line up their discs vertically, horizontally or diagonally
wins.
Also, if you have no available moves left, you lose.

Happy Corrom-Tac-Toeing!
